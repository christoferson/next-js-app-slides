## §1.1 pptxgenjs spike — **PASSED (with 4 constraints on the design)**

**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Pinned version:** `pptxgenjs@4.0.1` (exact; API names have shifted across majors — do not float this)
**Node:** v22.14.0 · **Platform:** win32 10.0.19045
**Harness:** `npm run verify:pptx:all` (re-runnable; green)

### Method

Eyeballing a deck proves little, so the spike asserts geometry **from the OOXML itself**:
`scripts/verify-pptx.ts` builds a deck exercising every capability, then
`scripts/verify-pptx-assert.ts` unzips it and compares `<a:off>` / `<a:ext>` EMU values
against the percent→inch math (914400 EMU/inch). 48/48 checks pass.
`scripts/verify-pptx-thirdparty.ts` re-reads the package with an unrelated parser
(`officeparser`) to catch structurally-broken output our own regexes would accept.

### Capability results

| # | Capability | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Custom 16:9 layout (`defineLayout` 10×5.625in) | ✅ | `<p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="5143500">`, ratio 1.777778 exactly |
| 2 | Full-bleed background image | ✅ | `off=(0,0)`, `ext=(9144000,5143500)` — pixel-exact to slide extent |
| 3 | Text box at percent-derived coords | ✅ | **worst delta across all 5 probe zones = 0 EMU** |
| 4 | `align` / `valign` | ✅ | left/center/right → `algn="l|ctr|r"`; top/middle/bottom → `anchor="t|ctr|b"` |
| 5 | Bullets, itemized runs, nesting | ✅ | `<a:buChar>`, `<a:buAutoNum>`, `lvl="1"` |
| 6 | Server-side buffer output | ✅ | `write({outputType:"nodebuffer"})` → real `Buffer` |
| 7 | Logo image in a corner | ✅ | second `<p:pic>` at declared offset |
| 8 | Speaker notes | ✅ | `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide1.xml` with the text |
| 9 | CJK (`日本語も確認`) | ✅ | round-trips unescaped in `<a:t>`; `<a:ea>` typeface set too (see C1) |
| 10 | Token-styled path (no bg image) | ✅ | `<p:bg>` solid fill + `addShape('rect')` accent bar |
| 11 | Both render modes in ONE deck | ✅ | templated slides → master layout; token slides → own `<p:bg>` (probe O) |
| 12 | 15-slide deck timing | ✅ | 23–129 ms to buffer — nowhere near a concern |
| 13 | Base64 (`data:`) image input | ✅ | works for slide images AND master backgrounds — **no filesystem paths needed**, so §6.4 (ports must not return fs paths) holds |

**Zone model is sound as specified.** Percent→inch→EMU is exact, so `resolveZones()` can be
shared verbatim between the React preview and `toPptx` (§8) with no fudge factors.

### The 4 constraints the design must absorb

These are library facts, verified in source and output — not blockers, but the exporter must
be written around them.

#### C1 — `fit:'shrink'` is inert at export time (affects truncation budgets)

`fit:'shrink'` emits `<a:normAutofit/>` **with no `fontScale` attribute**. The library's own
typings say it plainly (`types/index.d.ts` ~L1810): *"There is no way for this library to
trigger that behavior."* PowerPoint computes the scale factor only when a user edits or
resizes the shape — so **on first open, over-long text overflows its box** rather than shrinking.

`fit:'none'` emits no autofit element at all; text silently spills past the box with no clipping.

→ **Truncation must be enforced in our code, not delegated to PowerPoint.** This makes the
§9 `trimmed` flag load-bearing rather than cosmetic. First-cut budgets from measured box
widths (avg advance ≈ 0.5em) are in `scripts/verify-pptx-probe2.ts` probe C — e.g. a 60%-wide
title at 28pt holds ~30 chars/line; a 52%×34% bullets zone at 16pt holds ~46 chars × 7 lines.
Calibrate `SlotSpec.maxChars` against these, then re-check on the real fonts.

Also note `shrinkText` (used in the CLAUDE.md §1.1 example snippet) is **deprecated** in 4.0.1
in favour of `fit`. The example should be updated.

#### C2 — Native `sizing: {type:'contain'|'cover'}` is unusable; use explicit letterbox math

The library derives its aspect ratios from the **declared `w`/`h`**, not the image's intrinsic
pixels (`dist/pptxgen.cjs.js`: `ImageSizingXml` ~L5056 + call site ~L5560). Consequences:

- `sizing:{type:'contain', w:10, h:5.625}` on a 4:3 source produced `srcRect="0,0,0,0"` and a
  **stretched, distorted** 16:9 image — it did not letterbox.
- A mismatched box (`w:4,h:5`) produced `srcRect t="-61111" b="-61111"` — **negative crop
  values, invalid OOXML**.

→ Do **not** use `sizing`. `scripts/letterbox.ts` implements `placeBackground()` +
`imageSize()` (PNG/JPEG intrinsic dimensions, no image dependency) and is table-tested in
`scripts/verify-pptx-letterbox-test.ts` — 7 aspect cases (16:9, near-16:9, 4:3, 21:9, 9:16,
contain/cover/stretch), all centred, aspect preserved, and proven end-to-end to serialize with
no negative `srcRect`. Near-16:9 (within 0.5%) snaps to full-bleed; sub-1% distortion is the
deliberate trade. **Documented choice for §8: `contain` (pillarbox/letterbox), `letterboxed: true`
drives the amber badge.**

#### C3 — Media is NOT deduplicated; put brand backgrounds on slide masters

`addImage` embeds a **separate copy per slide**, even for a byte-identical `path` or `data:`
string. Measured with a 33 KB 1920×1080 background over 15 slides:

| Approach | Deck size | Media parts |
|---|---|---|
| `addImage` per slide (`path`) | 611 KB | 15 (1 distinct) |
| `addImage` per slide (`data:`) | 611 KB | 15 (1 distinct) |
| **`defineSlideMaster({background})`** | **146 KB** | **1** |

→ **The exporter must define one slide master per distinct brand template background**
(`defineSlideMaster({title, background:{data}})`, slides added with `{masterName}`). Verified:
3 distinct backgrounds over 15 slides → exactly 3 media parts; zone text geometry is
**unaffected** by using a master (still EMU-exact); base64 masters work; templated and
token-styled slides coexist in one deck.

Caveat: a master background **always** stretches to the slide (`<a:stretch><a:fillRect/>`, no
`srcRect`). So a non-16:9 asset would be **distorted** as a master background — such assets
must fall back to slide-level `addImage` with C2's contain math, forfeiting dedup for that
asset. Acceptable: non-16:9 uploads are the warned edge case, not the norm.

#### C4 — Zero input validation; our zod schemas are the only guard

- Out-of-bounds zones are **not clamped**: a zone at `x:90,w:40` serialized to `off.x=8229600`
  with `ext.cx=3657600` — i.e. 1.9 in off the right edge of a 10 in slide. Negative coords pass
  through as negative EMU.
  → §1.1's requirement that brand-schema zod enforce `0..100` non-degenerate bounds is
  **load-bearing**, not belt-and-braces.
- Unknown `fontFace` is written verbatim with no error (PowerPoint substitutes silently).
- A missing image path **throws** at `write()` time (`ERROR: Unable to read media: …`) — so the
  exporter must resolve assets defensively; one dangling `backgroundAssetId` otherwise fails
  the entire export, not one slide.
- Every slide gets a `notesSlide` part even with no `addNotes` call (19 of 20 empty in the
  probe deck) — harmless, just deck-size noise.

### Fonts

All 16 candidate `pptxName` values are written verbatim into the OOXML —
**pptxgenjs performs no substitution or validation of its own** (`dist/pptxgen.cjs.js` L5963
sets `<a:latin>`, `<a:ea>`, and `<a:cs>` all to the given name, which also means one
`fontFace` covers CJK runs; no separate East-Asian font control is available or needed).

Candidate registry: `scripts/fonts-candidates.ts` (SPEC.md calls for a "curated registry with
PPTX-safe mappings" but does not enumerate it — this is the **proposal**, not yet ratified).
15 of 16 are installed on this dev machine; `Aptos` is not.

**Font embedding is not supported by pptxgenjs** (no `embedFont`/`fntdata` anywhere in the
dist), so substitution risk cannot be eliminated in-library — only managed by choosing
widely-installed faces. Substitution is a **render-time** behaviour, invisible in the XML;
it can only be cleared by the human open-test below.

| Tier | Entries | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `core` (web-safe, Win + Mac Office) | Arial, Georgia, Verdana, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Courier New | low |
| `office` (bundled with Office) | Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Constantia, Corbel, Franklin Gothic Book, Garamond | low–medium |
| `risky` (Windows-only / newer) | Segoe UI, Aptos | **medium — likely substituted on macOS PowerPoint / Google Slides** |

### ⚠️ VERIFY — open

1. **⚠️ The human PowerPoint open-test has NOT been performed.** Neither PowerPoint nor
   LibreOffice is installed on this machine (`POWERPNT.EXE` not found; no `soffice.exe`), so
   the render-time gate in §1.1 and §13 is **not yet cleared**. Everything above is proven at
   the OOXML level, which is strictly stronger for geometry but says **nothing** about font
   substitution or visual overflow.
   → **`out/OPEN-TEST.pptx`** (21 slides, `npm run verify:pptx:opentest`) exists for exactly
   this. Each slide carries its own `CONFIRM:` line; the font slides pair each specimen against
   a red Calibri control, so substitution shows up as "the two lines look identical".
   Run it on a machine with PowerPoint — ideally also Keynote and Google Slides — and record
   results here.
2. **Font tiers unconfirmed at render time.** Any entry that substitutes must be dropped from
   `FONTS` before it ships (§14). `Aptos` and `Segoe UI` are the expected casualties on macOS.
3. **`FONT_CANDIDATES` is a proposal**, not a ratified registry — the `webStack` values (browser
   preview approximations) have had no visual comparison against their `pptxName` counterparts.
4. **Char budgets in C1 are arithmetic estimates**, not measured text metrics. Re-derive per
   font from the open-test, or measure with a font-metrics library if tighter budgets matter.

`npm run verify:pptx:all` re-runs the whole gate. `npm run verify:pptx:opentest` rebuilds the
manual artifact.

### Carry into implementation

- `zone-math.ts` and `letterbox.ts` are the §8 "one shared util, two consumers" — move them to
  `lib/layouts/` (or `lib/export/`) rather than reimplementing.
- Exporter: one `defineSlideMaster` per distinct background (C3); slide-level `addImage` +
  `placeBackground` only for non-16:9 assets.
- Never use `sizing` (C2); never rely on `fit:'shrink'` to save over-long text (C1).
- Pin `pptxgenjs@4.0.1` exactly.

## §1.2 Bedrock spike — NOT RUN
## §1.3 Environment sanity — NOT RUN

Neither was in scope for this pass.
